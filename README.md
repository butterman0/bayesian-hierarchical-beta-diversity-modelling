# Bayesian Hierarchical Beta Diversity Modelling

A Python package for modelling **beta diversity** using **Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling** ([GDM](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13459)) and its **hierarchical Bayesian extension** ([spGDMM](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14259)).

This repository currently serves as a placeholder for the research code underpinning my work on **plankton beta-diversity modelling**.  

A **fully documented, user-friendly release** is planned for **mid 2026**.

## What is this?

This package forms part of my PhD research in quantitative marine ecology, focused on modelling beta diversity from **environmental** and **eDNA** data.  

It implements and extends GDM within a **hierarchical Bayesian framework (spGDMM)** to capture spatial structure, uncertainty, and compositional relationships in biodiversity data.

The project integrates:

- **Quantitative methods** – hierarchical Bayesian inference, spatial Gaussian processes, and spline-based dissimilarity modelling  
- **Scientific Python tools** – `xarray`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `pymc`, `matplotlib`  
- **Geospatial and environmental data** – large-scale marine datasets from ocean models, satellites, and in-situ sampling  
- **Reproducible code** – modular, well-documented code using `git`

## Planned features

- GDM and spGDMM models with a consistent, scikit-learn-like API  
- Spatial and compositional preprocessing utilities  
- Model evaluation and uncertainty summaries  
- Visualisation tools for dissimilarity, residuals, and spatial effects  

## Status

**Pre-release / research-only.**  
Interfaces and structure are under active development.
