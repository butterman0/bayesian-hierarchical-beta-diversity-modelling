# Bayesian Hierarchical Beta Diversity Modelling

A compact, public landing page for the Bayesian Hierarchical Beta Diversity Modelling project (spGDMM-related).

## Purpose
This repository provides a minimal public snapshot describing an experimental Python implementation of hierarchical models for beta diversity (e.g., spatial generalized Dirichlet-multinomial and related approaches). It is intended as a safe, pinnable landing page that points to research goals, roadmap, and contribution guidelines without exposing private experimental artifacts.

This public repo contains:
- A short README describing the project's purpose
- A roadmap outlining planned work and milestones
- Contribution guidelines and templates to make community collaboration easier
- A permissive MIT license

> Note: This public landing repo is intentionally minimal. Full code, notebooks, and experimental data may remain in private repositories.

## Status
Early-stage / research prototype — components and APIs may change. See ROADMAP.md for planned milestones.

## Highlights
- Reference implementation planned for core hierarchical beta-diversity components
- Example notebooks and small datasets are planned
- Focus on reproducibility and small, easy-to-review contributions
