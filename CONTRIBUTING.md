# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

Please follow these guidelines to make collaboration smooth.

## How to contribute
- Browse open issues and pick one you can help with.
- Open a new issue for bug reports or feature requests (use templates).
- For code contributions, fork the repo, create a topic branch, and open a pull request.

## Development workflow
- Fork → branch named `feature/brief-description` or `fix/brief-description` → commit → PR
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Provide a concise PR description explaining the change, motivation, and testing performed.

## Code style & tests
- Prefer idiomatic Python (PEP8). Use black/flake8 if available.
- Add tests for new features or bug fixes where practical.

## Communication
- Use issues for discussion before major changes.
- For sensitive or private-data questions, contact the maintainer directly.
