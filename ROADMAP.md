# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned milestones and priorities for the public landing repository.

## Goal
Provide a clear, minimal public snapshot that explains the project's purpose and invites community contributions.

## Short-term (next 1–3 months)
- Publish README with purpose and links (this repo)
- Add minimal example notebook demonstrating the model on a toy dataset
- Add LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING guidelines
- Create issue templates for bugs & feature requests

## Medium-term (3–9 months)
- Stabilize core model API and unit tests
- Add CI checks for linting and basic tests
- Provide a small example dataset with preprocessing script
- Document model evaluation metrics and sample results

## Long-term (9+ months)
- Expand example notebooks using real-world datasets
- Add tutorials and a reproducible experiment pipeline
- Consider packaging as a pip-installable module once stable

## Milestones
- v0.1-public: README + roadmap + templates + license (public landing)
- v0.2-alpha: core implementation + basic notebook + tests
- v1.0: stable API + documentation + packaging
